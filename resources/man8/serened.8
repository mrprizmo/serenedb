NAME
  <COMMAND> - the SereneDB database server
SYNOPSIS
  <COMMAND> [options] database-directory
DESCRIPTION
  The <COMMAND> binary can be used to start the SereneDB database
  server. By default, the server will run in a mode that allows clients
  to connect to it via the network. The server also has an emergency
  console mode that can be used for any sort of maintenance
  operations. In the emergency console mode, the server does not allow
  any clients to connect.  The server can be stopped gracefully at any
  time by pressing CTRL-C or by sending the SIGINT signal to the
  process.

  This metric reflects the current number of Agency callbacks being
  registered, including Agency cache callbacks.
  This metric was named `serenedb_agency_callback_count` in previous versions
  of SereneDB.
threshold: |
  This number is usually low, between `10` or `20`. It can temporarily
  increase while there are ongoing DDL operations in the cluster. The
  number should go down again once the DDL operations have finished.
troubleshoot: |
  If this number is considerably higher, this should be investigated.
  Please contact support.

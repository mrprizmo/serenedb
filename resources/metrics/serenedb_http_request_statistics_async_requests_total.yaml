description: |
  This counter reflects the total number of **asynchronous** HTTP
  requests which have hit this particular instance of `serened`. Asynchronous
  refers to the fact that the response is not sent with the HTTP response,
  but is rather queried separately using the `/_api/jobs` API.
  
  Note that this counter is ever growing during the lifetime of the
  `serened` process. However, when the process is restarted, it starts
  from scratch. In the Grafana dashboards, it is usually visualized as a
  rate per second, averaged with a sliding window of a minute.

  This metrics reflects the performance of an instance in a certain way.
  Note that your mileage may vary according to available resources as well
  as to complexity of the requests the client sends.

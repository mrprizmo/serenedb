description: |
  Number of shards on this machine. Every shard has a leader and
  potentially multiple followers. This metric counts both leader and
  follower shards.
troubleshoot: |
  Since both leader and follower shards use memory and disk space,
  the total number of shards should be approximately balanced
  evenly across the DB-Servers.

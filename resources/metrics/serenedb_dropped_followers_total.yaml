description: |
  Total number of drop-follower events. This metric is increased on leaders
  whenever a write operation cannot be replicated to a follower during
  synchronous replication, and it would be unsafe in terms of data consistency
  to keep that follower.
  This metric was named `serenedb_dropped_followers_count` in previous
  versions of SereneDB.
threshold: |
  Usually, drop-follower events should only happen if servers are
  restarted or if there are real problems on followers.

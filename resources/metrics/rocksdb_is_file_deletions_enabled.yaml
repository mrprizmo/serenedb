  This metric exhibits the RocksDB metric `rocksdb-is-file-deletions-enabled`.
  It shows `0` if deletion of obsolete files is enabled, and otherwise,
  it shows a non-zero number. Note that for SereneDB, this is supposed
  to always return `1`, since the deletion of obsolete WAL files is done
  from SereneDB, externally to RocksDB.

description: |
  Number of leader shards not fully replicated. This is counted for all
  shards for which this server is currently the leader. The number is
  increased by one for every shards for which not all followers are in sync.

  Needless to say, such a situation is not good resilience, since we
  do not have as many copies of the data as the `replicationFactor`
  prescribes. If this metrics has a value greater than 0, then some
  action is indicated. During an upgrade or when some DB-Server was
  restarted, it can happen that shard followers are out of sync.
  Normally, shards should get in sync on their own, so observation
  and waiting is a good measure at first.

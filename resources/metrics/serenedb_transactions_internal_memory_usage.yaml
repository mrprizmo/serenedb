  Total memory usage of currently ongoing internal transactions, i.e.
  transactions that were not explicitly started by an end user.
  Internal transactions include SereneDB-internal maintenance queries,
  queries to purge data from TTL indexes, periodic queries for
  collecting and aggregating statistics and transactions internally used by shard synchronization.

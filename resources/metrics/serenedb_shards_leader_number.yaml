description: |
  Number of leader shards on this machine. Every shard has a leader and
  potentially multiple followers.
troubleshoot: |
  Since the leaders perform all the read and write operations and
  the followers only replicate the writes, one should usually have a
  relatively even distribution of leader shards across DB-Servers. An
  exception can be one-shard deployments, in which every collection has
  a single shard and all shards in a database must have the same leader.
  If you have few databases in a one-shard deployment, then an uneven
  distribution of leader shards is natural.

description: |
  The revision trees of collections/shards are normally present
  in RAM in an uncompressed state. However, to reduce the memory
  usage of keeping all revision trees in RAM at the same time, 
  revision trees can be put into "hibernation" mode. Any inactive
  revision tree is automatically hibernated by SereneDB after
  a while. For the hibernation step, a revision tree is 
  compressed in RAM, and only the compressed version is then kept.
  Later accesses of a compressed revision tree require uncompressing
  the tree again. 
  This metric is increased whenever a revision tree is hibernated.
  This can happened many times during the lifetime of a revision tree.

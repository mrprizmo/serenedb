description: |
  Number inverted indexes that are currently out of sync. 
  A link or inverted index is out of sync if the recovery for 
  it is intentionally skipped or a commit operation on the 
  link/index has failed.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric contains a value greater than zero, the
  log files should be checked to find out which indexes
  are affected. The out-of-sync indexes should then
  be dropped and recreated.

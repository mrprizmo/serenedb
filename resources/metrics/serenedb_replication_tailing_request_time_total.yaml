  Aggregated wait time for replication tailing requests.
troubleshoot:
  If you see unusual spikes here, please inspect potential
  network issues. It may help to increase network bandwidth
  and/or reduce network latency. In case there are no network
  issues, also check the load of the serving leader DB-Server,
  as well as the follower DB-Server, as they could potentially
  be overloaded and reaching hardware-based limits.

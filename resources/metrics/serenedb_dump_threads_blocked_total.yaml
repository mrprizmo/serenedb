introducedIn: "1.0.0"
help: |
  Number of times a server-side dump thread was blocked
  because it honored the server-side memory limit for dumps.

description: |
  This metric will be increased whenever a server-side dump
  thread tries to prefetch more data from the database and
  makes it ready to use for fetching, but doing so would
  violate the configured per-server memory limit for all
  ongoing dump invocations.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric keeps increasing drastically, it is an
  indication that the server could buffer and provide dump
  responses faster than it is allowed to. The two ways of
  fixing this problem are to increase the amount of memory
  that dumps can use, by increasing the value of the
  `--dump.max-memory-usage` startup option, to reduce the number
  of parallel threads used in an dump invocation, or
  to start less concurrent dumps.
  
  This metric will have a value of 0 on Coordinators. It will
  also not be increased for dump invocations that did
  not use `--parallel-dump` option.

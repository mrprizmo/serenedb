  ClientFast,

  // For requests that execute an AQL query or are tightly
  // related like simple queries,
  // that do AQL requests, user administrator that
  // internally uses AQL.
  ClientAql,

  // For requests that might block or wait for something,
  // which are not CLIENT_AQL.
  ClientSlow,

  // Used for all requests sent by the web interface
  ClientUi,

  // For requests between agents. These are basically the
  // requests used to implement RAFT.
  AgencyInternal,

  // For requests from the DBserver or Coordinator accessing
  // the agency.
  AgencyCluster,

  // For requests from the DBserver to the Coordinator or
  // from the Coordinator to the DBserver. But not having high priority.
  ClusterInternal,

  // Internal AQL requests, or continuations. Low priority.
  ClusterAql,

  // For requests from the DBserver to the Coordinator, and continuations on the
  // Coordinator.
  // These have medium priority. Because client requests made against the
  // RestCursorHandler (with lane CLIENT_AQL) might block and need these to
  // finish. Ongoing low priority requests can also prevent low priority lanes
  // from being worked on, having the same effect.
  ClusterAqlInternalCoordinator,

  // Shutdown request for AQL queries, i.e. /_api/aql/finish/<id> on the
  // DBserver. This calls have slightly higher priority than normal AQL requests
  // because the query shutdown can release resources and unblock other
  // operations.
  ClusterAqlShutdown,

  // DOCUMENT() requests inside cluster AQL queries, executed on DBservers.
  // These requests will read a locally available document and do not depend
  // on other requests. They can always make progress. They will be initiated
  // on coordinators and handling them quickly may unblock the coordinator
  // part of an AQL query.
  ClusterAqlDocument,

  // For requests from the DBserver to the Coordinator or
  // from the Coordinator to the DBserver for administration
  // or diagnostic purpose. Should not block.
  ClusterAdmin,

  // For requests used between leader and follower for
  // replication to compare the local states of data.
  ServerReplication,

  // For requests used between leader and follower for
  // replication to go the final mile and get back to
  // in-sync mode (wal tailing)
  ServerReplicationCatchup,

  // For synchronous replication requests on the follower
  ServerSynchronousReplication,

  // Internal tasks with low priority
  InternalLow,

  // Default continuation lane for requests (e.g. after returning from a network
  // call). Some requests, such as CLUSTER_AQL, will have a different
  // continuation lane for more fine-grained control.
  Continuation,

  // Not yet used:
  // For requests which go from the agency back to coordinators or
  // DBservers to report about changes in the agency. They are fast
  // and should have high prio. Will never block.
  // AGENCY_CALLBACK`

  // Used by futures that have been delayed using Scheduler::delay.
  DelayedFuture,

  // undefined request lane, used only in the beginning
  Undefined,
